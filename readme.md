GFA in Rust
==============

This crate provides Rust types and parsers for the GFA (Graphical
Fragment Assembly) format.

## Compatibility

Most of the [version 1 specification](https://github.com/GFA-spec/GFA-spec/blob/master/GFA1.md) is implemented, except for the optional fields, which
are currently not parsed.
